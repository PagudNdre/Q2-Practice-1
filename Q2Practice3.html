                <span class="lead">Haikyuu!!</span> follows <span class="fw-bold">Shōyō Hinata,</span> a short but determined volleyball player inspired by the legendary <span class="fst-italic">“Little Giant.”</span> After losing badly to the gifted setter Tobio Kageyama in middle school, Hinata enters Karasuno High only to discover Kageyama is now his teammate. The two form a powerful but initially rocky partnership, combining Hinata’s speed with Kageyama’s precision. As Karasuno rebuilds from its reputation as <span class="text-decoration-underline">“The Fallen Crows,”</span> the team trains intensely and faces strong rivals like Nekoma, Aoba Johsai, and Shiratorizawa. Through dramatic matches and personal growth, each player learns to overcome weaknesses and trust one another. The story culminates in Karasuno reaching the national stage, where Hinata and Kageyama continue striving toward their dreams.
